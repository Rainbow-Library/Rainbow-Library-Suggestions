Noticed a bug, have a great new feature in mind? 
Make an issue in this repository, and we'll see what we can add!

We do ask that you follow the issue templates, to ensure that we have
a clear understanding of what you're suggesting, and how we can address
it.

## Which Template Should I Use?
These templates are for issues and ideas related to our VRChat worlds.

### [World Bug Report](https://github.com/Rainbow-Library/Rainbow-Library-Suggestions/issues/new?template=world-bug-report.md)
Use this for functional problems or broken behavior in a world.
- Examples:
	- Buttons, toggles, or pickups not working (e.g., "DJ tablet won’t grab on Quest").
	- Spawn point puts players inside/under geometry.
	- Mirror toggle fails after respawn or world reload.
	- Portals or doors lead to the wrong location.
- Helpful details to include: exact location/area, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, platform (PC/Quest), and any world toggles you changed.

### [World Bug Visual Emergency](https://github.com/Rainbow-Library/Rainbow-Library-Suggestions/issues/new?template=world-bug-visual-emergency.md)
Use this for urgent visual issues that may harm photosensitive users.
- Examples:
	- Rapid strobing or flashing lights on the dance floor.
	- Flickering textures or shaders (e.g., skybox/trees flicker when you move the camera).
	- Extremely bright materials or rapid color cycling signage.
- What to include: how to see the issue safely, area of the world, severity (Critical/High/Moderate), platform (PC/Quest), and any relevant graphics settings.

### [World Feature Request](https://github.com/Rainbow-Library/Rainbow-Library-Suggestions/issues/new?template=world-feature-request.md)
Use this to suggest improvements, options, or new content for a world.
- Examples:
	- Add a performance mode toggle (disable heavy post-processing/fog).
	- Provide additional seating or better navigation/wayfinding signage.
	- Add a mirror or lighting controls in specific areas.
	- Accessibility tweaks (e.g., reduce bloom, clearer interaction prompts).
- Tips: describe the problem the feature solves, the solution you’d like, and any alternatives you’ve considered.
